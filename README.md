## Stranding continental crustal fragments during continental break-up: mantle suture reactivation in the Nain province of Eastern Canada

### Abstract 

The Earth’s continental crust has evolved via a series of supercontinent cycles, resulting in a patchwork of Archaean cores surrounded by terranes, fragments and slivers of younger crustal additions. However, the dispersal (and/or stranding) of continental fragments during break-up is not well understood. Inherited structures from previous tectonic activity may explain the generation of continental terranes through controlling first-order deformation during rifting. Here, we explore the influence of lithospheric deformation related to ancient orogenesis, focusing on the impact of the Torngat Orogen in the genesis of the Nain Province continental fragment in Eastern Canada. We present 3-D continental extension models in the presence of an inherited lithospheric structure and find that a narrow continental terrane could be separated and stranded by deep lithospheric scarring. The results show that continental terranes formed by this method would be limited to a width of 100 – 150 km, imposed by tectonic conditions during continental suturing. The findings have broad implications, demonstrating an original theory on the fundamental geological problem of terrane generation and continental breakup.
