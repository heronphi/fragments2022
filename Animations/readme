Here are a number of animations that follow the relevant figures: 

•	Surface_EXP1_EXP2 shows the surface evolution of NAC for model EXP1 and EXP2 in 1 Myr time outputs (e.g., Figure 3). 
•	Surface_Strain_EXP1_EXP2 shows the surface evolution of strain for model EXP1 and EXP2 in 1 Myr time outputs (e.g., Figure 3).
•	Cross_EXP1 and Cross_EXP2 show the cross section across the middle of the box in 2 Myr time outputs, displaying composition evolution for models EXP1 and EXP2. 
•	Strain_cross_EXP1 shows the cross section across the middle of the box in 2 Myr time outputs, displaying strain rate and composition evolution.
